If we are going to deploy this on production, what do you think the next improvement
that you will prioritize next? This can be a feature, a tech debt, or an architectural
design.

Feature(s):
Dashboard(analytics) - Maybe we should add analytics feature to monitor the employee's performance and their attendances. In that analytics also we can monitor rankings,
                      like "Best in late", "The Early bird", etct.
User manager module - in this module we can add users, user actions, modules, modules access, user roles, data access and components dynamically. For example, you cannot add a user
                      in backend anymore, you can simply add it on the user manager interface.
                      
face scan - the application maybe also have face scan. Today, we have already libraries about machine learning like image recognition. By that, its more secure to have 
          face scan to avoid stealing of time.

database - the should have big server for its database because every day maybe hundreds or thousands of data inserted at a time/day

load balancers - this may also important because if the server is down, the load balancer will redirect to the replica server and treat it as a main server.
